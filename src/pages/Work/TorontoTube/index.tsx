                            Toronto is one of the most well known cities in Canada, attracting thousands of tourists each year. With the current pandemic, many people are cautious about touching common surfaces. Having contactless payment methods on public transit may make users more comfortable with taking the TTC during this time.

                            My target audience is the tech savvy Millennial and older Gen Z age group who have adapted to contactless payment already such as Apple Pay.

                            For newcomers who just moved to Toronto, or visitors who want to explore the city, this Contactless Payment method allows the riders to have a much more seamless experience when riding the TTC. Rather than having to buy a pass at Shoppers Drug Mart, or last minute at a station, riders can just scan a QR code at a station to purchase a mobile card to load and ride the TTC as much or as little as they want.

                                    With this streamlined payment process, the user is able to access all information related to the TTC in one location.
                                    When users first move to Toronto and want to use the TTC, it is not clear where riders can purchase a Presto Pass; not all Shoppers Drug Mart stores carry Presto Passes, and not all subway station entrances lead to a kiosk with a staff member to assist them.

                                    The Toronto Tube app can fill in the gap for riders who are new to the TTC or are only visiting for a short period of time. Rather than having kiosks at various stations, or finding a Shoppers Drug Mart, users can scan a QR Code at the entrance of subway stations or bus/streetcar shelters to pay their fare.

User is able to choose the amount the want to be automatically reloaded as well as the balance of when they want to trigger the automatic reload. The user will receive a notification on the app when their credit card has been charged, as well as an email, should they choose those in the notification settings.

                                    The TTC is most recognisable from itâ€™s red logo you can find on the streetcars, busses, subway carriages, and signs around the city. I wanted to create a logo that encompasses that. The red of the logo, is the only colour I use, other than black, white, and gray throughout the entire app.
